<h3>"use strict"; defines that JS code should be executed in "strict mode"</h3>

<p>You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, <br>like preventing you from using undeclared variables. <br>

"use strict" is just a string, so IE 9 will not throw an error even if it does not understand it.</p>


<h3>Using a variable without declaring it, is not allowed.</h3>

<p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>

<script>
"use strict";
x = 3.14;  // This will cause an error (x is not defined).
</script>


<script>
"use strict";
myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  y = 3.14;   // This will cause an error (y is not defined)
}
</script>
